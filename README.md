# Instrumentalist

Phase 1: Create a virtual drum machine
DrumMode = pinch detection on both hands
Gain on drums = average velocity of hand movement

Phase 2?: Expand app to include piano and guitar

## Todo

- Calculate pinch
- Calculate velocity
- Import Tone or other music library
- Tie pinch to trigger drum sample
- Tie velocity to gain

## Done

- Import MediaPipe
- getting vision library via cdn @mediapipe/tasks-vision
- Console logging finger values
- checking if left and right hand are present
